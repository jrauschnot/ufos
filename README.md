## Summary:

- Design drawback: 

    * A design drawback is that the UFO website filter only allows data to be filtered and evaluated in a read format without ability to download or add new data points or UFO encounters. 

- Design recommendations: 

    *  Allow write capabilities for new validated UFO encounters to be added to the data set. 

    * Alloow data to be exported as a .csv file for additional analysis based upon relative geographic location to other data points.
